# Distributed Serverless Peer-to-Peer Data Synchronization App

**Project Name**: (Placeholder: Update this section with a relevant project name if desired)

---

## Overview

This project was created as an attempt to build an innovative, serverless, distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) application for personal data synchronization across multiple devices. The goal was to create a seamless, real-time data-sharing experience entirely independent of centralized servers. The application aimed to enable users to efficiently sync and manage their own data between devices by leveraging emerging P2P technologies. Although ultimately abandoned due to technical challenges and the limitations of certain networking scenarios, the project demonstrates an intriguing proof-of-concept that showcases technical ingenuity and provides valuable learnings.

This application was implemented using a combination of cutting-edge web technologies and frameworks, primarily **Gun.js**, **WebRTC**, **Ionic Framework**, and **React**. The result embodied an interconnected network with direct communication between devices. The project can serve as a portfolio piece for showcasing expertise with serverless and distributed paradigms, though it is currently inactive.

## Inspiration & Core Idea

The fundamental idea behind this project was to develop an application enabling users to "chat with oneself." In essence, the idea started as a personal data synchronization system, where users could sync files, texts, and other content between their own devices in real-time, without relying on any cloud-based servers or centralized infrastructure.

The application aimed to function as a self-hosted alternative to existing messaging apps or cloud-sharing processes, offering:

1. **Privacy** - Since all the communication was peer-to-peer, the data would never leave the user's devices or be stored in a third-party server.
2. **Real-Time Synchronization** - Using WebRTC and Gun.js, the plan was to sync data instantaneously whenever any of the devices were online and reachable.
3. **Distributed Architecture** - With the decentralized nature of Gun.js as a database, the system naturally lent itself to redundancy and ownership of data.

The potential expansion of this concept could include additional features, such as note-taking, task management, or even full-fledged distributed messaging with other peers. However, for the initial attempt, the focus was to use the application's underlying framework to synchronize data solely between a user's own devices.

## Technology Stack

This project was built using the following technologies and tools:

### Core Technologies:

-   **Gun.js:**  
     A lightweight, real-time distributed graph database that works in P2P networks. Gun.js was selected for its ability to replicate data among peers efficiently while maintaining a decentralized structure.
-   **WebRTC:**  
     WebRTC was employed for the peer-to-peer networking capabilities, enabling direct communication between devices without requiring a central server or intermediary. WebRTC allowed devices to establish real-time data channels for syncing texts or files.

### Frameworks and Libraries:

-   **Ionic Framework:**  
     The application was scaffolded as an **Ionic Framework** project. Ionic provided an excellent base for building cross-platform apps, allowing development for both mobile (iOS, Android) and web platforms from a single shared codebase.

-   **React:**  
     The front-end logic and user interface were built using **React**. React's declarative nature and component-based architecture made it suitable for creating dynamic, interactive interfaces for the app.

### Additional Tools:

-   **Local WebRTC STUN/TURN servers:** For WebRTC, STUN/TURN servers were briefly explored to enable connectivity in complex network configurations such as devices behind NAT (Network Address Translation).

## Challenges Faced

While the primary objectives were successfully implemented and a functional application was created, the project faced several critical pain points that eventually led to its discontinuation:

1. **NAT Traversal & Borderline Cases:**  
   A significant challenge was overcoming the issues caused by Network Address Translation (NAT). While WebRTC generally handles NAT traversal effectively, certain scenarios with restrictive firewalls or carrier-grade NAT made it difficult to achieve reliable peer-to-peer communication. Addressing these issues would have required additional infrastructure (e.g., deploying publicly accessible TURN servers), which conflicted with the goal of a completely serverless app.

2. **Edge Cases in Device Connectivity:**  
   In scenarios where both devices were offline, ensuring eventual synchronization upon reconnection was reliant on Gun.js's partial persistence and temporary data storage. This introduced complexities in data consistency, particularly for highly dynamic or larger data payloads.

3. **User Experience for Synchronization:**  
   Although the technical synchronization worked well in most cases, providing a seamless user experience across devices became challenging when dealing with unstable network conditions or delayed connectivity.

4. **Existing Alternatives:**  
   Upon evaluating the practical usability of the resulting application, it became evident that many existing messaging apps and cloud services (e.g., Telegram saved messages, Evernote, or Nextcloud) already fulfilled these use cases with greater polish and fewer technical roadblocks.

## Final Outcome

The project was a **successful proof-of-concept** and a testament to the possibilities of decentralized, serverless applications. Most of the core functionalities, including real-time data syncing and direct peer-to-peer communication using WebRTC and Gun.js, were implemented and worked as intended. However, the inherent limitations of P2P architectures for certain networking scenarios ultimately led to the project's abandonment.

While no longer actively maintained, this project represents a valuable learning experience and demonstrates the following technical proficiencies:

-   Building serverless, P2P applications.
-   Utilizing **Gun.js** for decentralized data storage.
-   Incorporating **WebRTC** to enable real-time communication channels.
-   Developing cross-platform mobile and web applications using **Ionic Framework** and **React**.
-   Handling challenges related to distributed systems and NAT traversal.

## Current Status

-   **Abandoned:**  
     This project is no longer being actively developed or maintained. It has been archived for portfolio purposes and as an example of experimenting with distributed P2P technology.

-   **Source Code:**  
     The source code has been preserved, and can be provided for educational or illustrative purposes. Note that this project is not production-ready and may contain unresolved issues or incomplete features.

## Getting Started (If you wish to deploy/test locally)

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Clone the source code repository (if made public), and ensure that all dependencies are installed.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    npm install
    ```

2. **Set Up WebRTC for Testing:**  
   Since WebRTC requires STUN/TURN servers to establish peer-to-peer connections, you can either use free STUN servers (e.g., from Google) or host your own.

3. **Run the App Locally:**  
   Use Ionic CLI to test the app in the browser or on a mobile device.  
   For development mode in a browser:
    ```bash
    ionic serve
    ```
    To deploy onto an actual mobile device, follow Ionic's documentation for platform-specific builds.
